I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher of the [RVP-Group](rvp-group.net) at "Sapienza" University of Rome.

My general research direction focuses on 3D Reconstruction. Specifically, I investigate the use of volumetric representations for geometric and appearance accurate 3D reconstruction.

Obviously it doesn't end here! My PhD focused on LiDAR-RGB Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), and I'm still tracking this line.
If you are interested in collaborations, or want to do a master thesis with me, feel free to contact me.
